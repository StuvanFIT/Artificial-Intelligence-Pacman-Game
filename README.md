To use Git, you can use the `git` command in the terminal or [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) if you prefer a GUI. Once ready for grading, push your code to your BitBucket repo and click the Evaluate My Code button in the grading portal. The grading system will pull your code from this BitBucket repo and run the evaluation.
